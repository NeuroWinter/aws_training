Which AWS service enables you to monitor the CPU utilization of your Amazon EC2 instance?
    Amazon CloudWatch

What is an Amazon Elastic Block Storage (Amazon EBS) optimized instance?
    An instance that uses an optimized configuration stack and provides additional, dedicated
    capacity for Amazon EBS I/O. This optimization provides the best performance for your
    EBS volumes by minimizing contention between Amazon EBS I/O and other traffic from your
    instance.

Which section of the AWS Elastic Beanstalk configuration file allows for the configuration of
the environment and AWS resources in it?
    Resources section

What is an Amazon Cognito user pool?
    A user directory in Cognito. Users can sign in to your web or mobile app through Cognito.
    Users can also sign in through social identity providers, such as Facebook or Amazon,
    and through SAML identity providers. Whether users sign in directly or through a third
    party, all members of the user pool have a directory profile that you can access through
    an AWS software development kit (AWS SDK).

Are you able to use AWS Microsoft AD with your existing on-premise implementation of
Microsoft Active Directory?
    Yes

Which serverless AWS services can function as the business or application tier?
    Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda

#### MY STUFF FROM HERE ####

### EBS

Using a GP2 EBS volume what is the min and max size
    1GB to 16TB

How many IOPS do you get per gb on GP2?
    3 IOPS per GB 
    With a max of 16000 IPPS when you get to 5.3 TB you are at the max.
    Small GP2 volumes can burst up to 3000 IOPS

What is an example usecase for the IO1 EBS volume type?
    Critical Business apps like Large DB workloads.

What is the min and max size of IO1 EBS volumes?
    4GB to 16TB

What is the min and max IOPS for IO1?
    This is called PIOPS (provisioned IOPS).
    Min == 100
    Max == 32000 for most instances and 64000 for NITRO.
    There is a max ratio of 50 to 1 IOPS per GB,
    So if I have a 10GB volume the max IOPS I can get is 500

What is a use case for ST1 EBS volume type?
    Big Data, Data warehousing and log processing.
    Its got a LOT of throughput per second.

What is the min and max size of ST1 EBS volumes?
    Min == 500GB
    Max == 16TB

What is the max IOPS for ST1 EBS volume?
    500 IOPS

What is a use case for SC1 EBS volumes?
    This is where you need super cheap storage, for data that is not accessed
    frequently, like a file server.
    Its similar to ST1 but lower IOPS and throughput.

Name all the EBS volume types that can be boot volumes.
    GP2, IO1, Magnetic (This is legacy)

Give a quick overview of what EBS is.
    EBS is a network drive attached to your EC2 instance, it is AZ bound.
    EBS volumes are persistent so the data will remain if you delete your EC2
    instance. You can also increase the size of them.

How are you billed for EBS.
    You are billed on the size and IOPS not how much you use.

How do you migrate a EBS volume to another AZ?
    You will need to create a snapshot and then restore from that snapshot to
    another AZ.

### EC2 Instance Store.

What is an EC2 Instance store?
    This is like a physical drive attached to your EC2 Instance.
    It is SUPER high IOPS since its physical, 100,000+ IOPS
    They are NOT backed up you will need to do this manually!

What is the max size of an EC2 Instance Store?
    7.5TB or stripped up to 40TB
    However you cant resize the size.

When will the data on the Instance Store get deleted?
    The underlying disk drive fails
    The instance stops
    The instance terminates

What are some use cases for EC2 Instance Stores?
    There is no network latency but it is ephemeral, so good for on host
    caching, or temporary data.

### EFS

What OS can use EFS?
    You can only use EFS on Linux based OS.

How are you billed for EFS?
    You are only billed on what you use.

What is a use case for EFS.
    Since EFS is not AZ bound you can use it to share data between different EC2
    instances.
    Use cases are Web serving, CMS or data sharing.

What are some of the benefits and draw backs for EFS?
    EFS is not AZ bound and can share data between EC2 Instances.
    You only pay for what you use.
    You can scale up to the petabytes of data.
    It is around 3 times the cost of EBS

What protocol does EFS use?
    NFSv4.1
    You will need to ensure that this is enabled in your Security Group.

What are the Performance classes for EFS.
    General purpose - good for Webserver
    Max I/O - good for big data and media processing.

What is one way you can reduce the cost of EFS?
    You can use Life cycle management (move file after X days)
    This will move a file from the standard storage tier to Infrequent
    access (EFS-IA). (EFS-IA) is cold storage, where it is super cheap to
    store, but you are charged to access it.

What do you do if you EC2 instance cannot connect to the EFS volume?
    Check that you have enabled NFS in your security groups.

### ELBS

What are the types of ELBS and what protocols do they support?
    Classic (CLB)     - HTTP, HTTPS, TCP (Layer 4 and 7)
    Application (ALB) - HTTP, HTTPS, Websockets (Layer 7 only)
    Network (NLB)     - TCP, TLS, UDP (Layer 4)

What does it mean when the ELB gets a 503 error?
    This means that the ELB is at capacity, It cannot find a healthy server to
    send the request to.

How does the ELB evaluate the health of a server?
    It will send a request to the heath endpoint, if it returns a 200 (OK), then
    the host is healthy, if it returns anything else its not.

If the ELB cannot connect to the  EC2 instances what should you check?
    This is normally a security group issue, make sure that the EC2 instance is
    accepting traffic from the ELBs security group.

What are some of the advantages of ALB over CLB?
    It supports redirects.
    It can balance multiple http apps across machines.
    Support load balancing to multiple apps on the same machine.
    This means its great to use ALB when you have micro services.
    You can set up heaps of different rules to route traffic based on things.

What is ALB Route routing?
    This is where a request will be routed to a different server/port based on
    something like the URL entered or the subdomain of the url.
    Or something like the query string or headers in the request.

What are the different types of ALB target groups?
    EC2 instance.
    ECS Tasks.
    Lambda function.
    Private IP.

What header is the clients original IP in?
    X-Forwarded-For, The port and the protocol is in the
    X-Fowarded-(Port and Proto)

Can you use Elastic IPs on a ALB?
    No to use EIPs you will need to use a NLB.

How many IPS does a NLB get?
    It will get one per AZ.

What are the 2 types of target groups for NLB?
    Instance
    IP

In what situations do you want to use NLB over ALB?
    When you want extreme performance and want a static IP per AZ.

What is Load Balancer Stickyness?
    This is where a client will connect to the same instance for each request.

When would you use Load Balancer Stickyness?
    When you need to make sure that the user does not loose its session data.

What are some of the draw backs when using Load Balancer Stickyness?
    It will introduce imbalance to the target instances.

Which LBs can use Stickyness?
    Only the CLB and ALB

What is Cross Zone Load Balancing?
    This is where each LB in each AZ can route traffic to any EC2 instance in
    any AZ.

Which LBs can use Cross Zone Load Balancing?
    All LB can use it, it is enabled by default and cannot be turned off for
    ALBs You can enable it on CLB and it is free. On NLBs it is disabled by
    default, and will cost.

What is SNI and what problem does it solve.
    SNI is Server Name Identification, it solves the problem of having multiple
    SSL certs on a single load balancer. 

What Load Balancers support SNI?
    SNI is only supported on ALB and NLB NOT CLB!

What is the other name for ELB connection draining, and what is it?
    Deregistration delay. This is the amount of time that the ELB will let
    requests finish on a server that is deemed unhealthy.

When would you change the default ELB connection draining time?
    The default is 300 seconds, and you would change it if your processing time
    for a request exceed  this normally.

### ASG ###

What is an auto scaling group?
    An Auto Scaling Group is a set of rules that define how your scale out or
    scale in based on load or some other metric.

What is an ASG made up of?
    A Launch config,
        AMI + Instance Type
        EC2 User Data
        EBS Volumes
        Security Groups
        SSH Key Pair
    Min/Max size, Network and subnet info, LB info, and Scaling Policies.

What happens if you attach an IAM role to the ASG?
    This IAM role will be applied to all EC2 instances launched by it.

How does the ASG know what instances to terminate?
    The ASG will terminate any instances that are reported to be unhealthy by
    the LB

What is one benefit of using a launch template over a launch configuration?
    With a template you can define a fleet of instances so you can launch
    different EC2 instance types and you can use spot instances.

What are the 3 different Scaling policies?
    Target, This is where you can define a target like average CPU usage to be
    40%, the ASG will launch and remove instances to try reach this target.
    Simple/Step, this is where you can scale by X based on a cloudwatch alarm,
    this lets you add and remove X instances when the alarm is in the alarm 
    state, and remove X when it is not.
    Scheduled, this is where you can add or remove instances at a particular
    time.

What is Scale CoolDown?
    This is the period that the ASG will wait between events to add or remove
    instances, with a shorter period you can save money as it will remove
    instances quicker.

### RDS ###

What Database technologies are supported by AWS?
    Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, Aurora.

What are some of the benefits of using RDS over hosting your own DB on EC2?
    Automated provisioning and OS updates.
    Automatic Backups.
    Monitoring Dashboards out of the box.
    Read Replicas.
    MultiAZ support.
    Vertical and horizontal scaling.

What EBS volumes are used by RDS?
    Either GP2 or IO1

How would you go about sshing into the RDS servers?
    This is not possible as it is an AWS managed service..

You don't want to create a new DB user for each member of the DEV team, how do
you give them access to the database?
    This can be done by enabling IAM authentication for RDS, and making sure
    that they have the right IAM permissions.

How is point in time restore implemented in RDS?
    There is a daily DB backup during the maintainice  window, and the
    Transactional logs are backed up every 5 min.

Your RDS backup policy is set to the default 7 days, however you want to retain
a single backup for 35 days, how would you do this?
    You should create a manual backup by creating a snapshot of the DB.

What SQL command is used to create READ replicas?
    ASYNC, this means that the read replicas will be eventually consistent with
    the master node.

What is normal use case for using Read Replicas?
    You have a reporting dashboard that will make a lot of SELECT queries to the
    DB, and you don't want to impact your master DB. 

You read online that you can only host read replicas in the same AZ, is this
True?
    No Read Replicas can be hosted either the same AZ, cross AZ or cross Region.

What considerations do you need to think about when hosting a read replica in a
different AZ?
    Since the replica is in a different AZ then there will be a cross AZ network
    cost.

What are some of the benefits of having a multi AZ deployment of RDS?
    A multi AZ deployment increases availability as if there is an issue with
    the master node then AWS will automatically fail over connections, to the
    salve. Our database will be behind a single DNS name and AWS will handle the
    rest.

You have a RDS domain that is not encrypted at rest, you want to fix this,
how would you go about it?
    Create a snapshot of the current domain, and restore the snapshot to an
    encrypted domain.

What are some benefits of using IAM authentication?
    All traffic to and from the DB is encrypted using SSL.
    You can leverage IAM roles to give granular access.
    The access token will only last for 15min

With RDS, what are your responsibilities?
    Inbound Security group rules
    Creating and managing DB users either in DB or using IAM
    Enforcing SSL and all the parameter groups for the instance.

With RDS, what are AWS responsibilities?
    Making sure there is no SSH
    DB and OS patching
    Making sure there is no access to the underlying instance.

What is DB technologies does Aurora support?
    MySQL and Postgres.

What is the max size of Aurora and what is the max size of RDS?
    Aurora is 64TB and RDS is 32TB

Give a brief over view of Aurora.
    Aurora has a scaling data storage layer where each piece of data is
    replicated 6 times across 3 AZs. There is a singe write node and up to 16
    read replicas per region. 

How do clients talk to an Aurora DB?
    There is a DNS record for both the reader and writer. The DNS record is
    updated when a new writer is promoted. The reader endpoint is a load
    balancer.

What DNS setting do you need to check when using Aurora?
    Make sure that the TTL for the DNS record for Aurora is short.

What are some of the main features of Aurora?
    Auto Failover.
    Auto backup.
    Isolation.
    Auto 0 time patching.
    Restore to any point of time.

What are the 4 different Aurora launch types and their benefits?
    One writer multiple readers - general purpose.
    One writer multiple readers - when you want to make sure you reporting or 
        analytics does not degrade your writer.
    Multiple writers - when your application is writing a lot.
    Serverless - when your workload is unpredictable.

How can you tell the difference between reader and writer Aurora endpoints?
    The Reader will have "-ro" in the endpoint name.

What is different between Aurora and Aurora Serverless?
    Aurora serverless will create db instances for you and auto scale on load.

What is a good use case for Aurora Serverless?
    When your db access is infrequent intermittent or unpredictable.

What is the underlying change to implement a global Aurora DB?
    Having Read Replicas spread out across regions. This means that if there is
    a disaster on one region then you can promote a reader in one region to a 
    writer.

### S3 ###

What are the 4 different types of encryption for S3?
    SSE-S3
    SSE-KMS
    SSE-C
    Client side encryption

What protocol must you send your data over when using SSE-C and why?
    You need to use HTTPS since you are sending private data.

When you enable versioning on an already existing bucket what version ID do the
current files get?
    Null

You already have a bucket then you enable encryption do the existing files get encrypted?
    No.

To enable S3 MFA delete what must you first enable?
    Versioning.

What account can enable S3 MFA-Delete?
    Only the root account.



### CLI SDK IAM roles and Policies ###

What order does the CLI look for credentials?
    Command line options
    Environment Variables
    credentials file
    Config file
    container credentials
    instance profiles

What order does the Java SDK look for credentials in?
    Environment variables.
    Java system properties
    default credential profiles file
    Container credentials
    instance profile credentials

How can you use MFA in the AWS CLI?
    You will need to call the aws sts get-session-token command with the arn
    of your MFA device and the code from it.

If you get intermittent errors from API rate limits what should you do?
    Implement exponential Back off.

What do you do if you get consistent API rate limit errors?
    Request an increase of your service limits.

What is SigV4?
    This is how your requests to AWS are signed with your credentials.

What are the two ways of using SigV4?
    Http/s header options
    Query string.

How do you get the instance ID of your EC2 machine programmatically?
    Query the instance MetaData using the 169.254.169.254 ip.

What language does the AWS CLI use?
    Python.

When using the SDK on an EC2 instance how does it get the right credentials?
    It queries the Meta data and gets temporary creds.

What is the priority in the CLI credentials chain?
    Command line options, environment variables, EC2 instance Profile. 

    face
